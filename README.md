# Overview
This is a small command line-based productivity app, based on the pomodoro technique. You start out by writing down what you aim to achieve over the next 5 sessions. Then a timer is set and and you get to work. When the timer finishes a box pops up which prompts you to write a brief summary of what you did in the last session. The entry is saved in a text file along with the time and date. You then have a short break. Rinse and repeat.

# Structure
- Basic timer will is a sleep function, followed by a pop-up/sound.
- A rest timer begins - another sleep timer followed by something (maybe an intrusive pop-up/sound).



# Future features
- Different projects could have different threads
- Add timestamps onto command line comments so you can see exactyl when the session began
- The pop-up will be the writing field. I think I can use tkinter for this.
