# Overview
This is a small command line-based productivity app, based on the pomodoro technique. You start out by writing down what you aim to achieve over the next 5 sessions. Then a timer is set and and you get to work. When the timer finishes a box pops up which prompts you to write a brief summary of what you did in the last session. The entry is saved in a text file along with the time and date. You then have a short break. Rinse and repeat.

# System requirements
As of yet, this will only work in OSX because it relies on osascript. I'm working on making it compatible with all platforms!

# Getting started
1. Open up `note-bank.bash` in your favourite text editor.
2. Change the variable `DIR` to the working directory you would like to save your notes to
3. In `file_path` change `notes.txt` to whatever you want your notes file to be called.
4. Run the app in terminal by entering `bash note-bank.bash` (make sure you're in the application directory).
5. Follow all of the directions in terminal

# New features
- Users can input their own working directory, so the notes are saved elsewhere on the computer (rather than just next to the .bash file). This means users can easily work on different threads/projects by just changing the file_path variable. It also keeps my personal notes separate from the app so can access it freely.

# Future features
- Compatibility with linux and Windows. Perhaps would need to rewrite everything in Python and use some of the available resources.
- Turn the pop-ups/alerts into the writing field for the summaries. I think I can use tkinter for this.
